We want to create an auction site.

Users can add new items to sell and a date to end the auction. Other users can bid for the item. Once the date limit has expired the item is sold to the user with the higest offer and it will not be possible to bid more.

Note: You don't need authentication for this. To identify a user just ask for his email. At this moment we will believe every user.
